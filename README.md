# flow
A 2D hydrodynamics mini-app

# Purpose

This application solves Eulers equations using an explicit Lagrangian-Eulerian method, with directional splitting to handle multi-dimensionality. The purpose of the application is for performance evaluation on modern architectures.

# Build

Before building the dependent `wet` application, it is necessary to clone the application into the `arch` project. The instructions can be found on the `arch` project README.

```
git clone git@github.com:uob-hpc/arch
cd arch
git clone git@github.com:uob-hpc/wet
cd wet
```

The `wet` build process is intended to be simple, and has been tested on a number of platforms.

```
make -j KERNELS=omp3 COMPILER=INTEL
```

The KERNELS option determines the particular kernel set that will be used when building the project. At this time the difference between the kernel sets is that they are written with different programming models. When you clone the repository there are multiple directories that contain duplicates of the core computational kernels, ported to different models and the name of the directory is the value to be used with the KERNELS option.

A number of other switches and options are provided:

- `DEBUG=<yes/no>` - 'yes' switches off optimisation and adds debug flags
- `MPI=<yes/no>` - 'yes' turns off any use of MPI within the application.
- `DECOMP=<TILES/ROWS/COLS> - determines the decomposition strategy (Warning: this hasn't been very well tested yet).
- The `OPTIONS` makefile variable is used to allow visit dumps, with `-DVISIT_DUMP`, and profiling, with `-DENABLE_PROFILING`.

# Run

Upon building, a binary file will be output with the extension of the value of KERNELS. e.g. `flow.omp3`. You can run the application with:

```
./flow.omp3 flow.params
```

# Configuration Files

The configuration files expose a number of key parameters for the application.

- `iterations` - the number of outer timestep iterations the application will proceed through
- `dt` - the timestep for the application
- `nx` - the number of cells in the x-dimension
- `ny` - the number of cells in the y-dimension
- `visit_dump` - whether the application should output visit dumps of the result

TODO: Describe the `problem` and `source` descriptions in the parameter file.
